But Abram said to the king of Sodom, 'I have raised my hands to ***God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth***, that I will take nothing of yours, from a thread to a sandal strap, lest you should say, 'I have made Abram rich'---except only what the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.'"

### Genesis 14:21-24
Abraham showed his **complete detachment from earthly wealth**, because:

1. He knew that **God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth** (v. 22[^1]) had given him everything he possessed.
2. He loved God supremely, and not the wealth God gave him. He also loved his neighbor as himself, for he saw to the needs of Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre.

Thus, Abraham was, so to speak, heaven-bound. The king of Sodom, on the other hand, was earthbound. Faithful people follow Abraham's example.

[^1]: "But Abram said to the king of Sodom, â€˜I have raised my hands to God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth," (Genesis 14:22, NKJV)
