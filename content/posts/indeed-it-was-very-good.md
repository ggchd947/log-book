> "Then God said, 'Behold, I have given you every seed-bearing herb that sows seed on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food. I also give every green plant as food for all the wild animals of the earth, for all the birds of heaven, and for everything that creeps on the earth in which is the breath of life.' It was so. ***Then God saw everything He had made, and indeed, it was very good. So evening and morning were the sixth day.***"

### Genesis 1:31
Everything God made, including man, is **very good**, because God is good. Nothing He made is therefore evil in itself. So then, human nature is good in itself. But sin is a free choice of man's will, and it is contrary both to God's nature and human nature.
